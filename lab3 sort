sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: to sort random and reversed ones took almost the same time meanwhile sorted one was always were multiple times fast

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: the other two sorting alghoritms were much more slower than this, therefore i assume that it is merge sort because
it's big O notation is fastest 

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: no matter which list i sorted it almost took the same amount of time to finish. selection sort is known to have O(n^2)
